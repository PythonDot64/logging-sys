## note
This is my first github program. If I did anything wrong, please tell me where I can improve.

Also, this is a program I have made on my own time, and I am not a expert programer, so it might not be the most optimized, but it works.
## How to run

IMPORTANT: Ensure you have Python version 3.0 or above installed in your computer. You can check by running "python --version" in your terminal.

1. download the files

2. open powershell and run "cd Downloads" then run "tar -xf logging-sys-main.zip"
 
3. run "cd logging-sys-main" then run "python main.py"
## Description
This is a program that can log you into your account using database and it can register an account for you.

When you log in, you can also play mini games such as rock paper scissors (you might only have one minigame depending on how early you download it).
